                I’m a full stack web developer who enjoys turning ideas into
                practical, well-structured web applications. My interest in
                development started with curiosity about how websites work
                behind the scenes, and over time it grew into hands-on
                experience building projects with modern web technologies.
              </p>
              <p>
                I work primarily with JavaScript, React, Node.js, and databases
                like MongoDB and MySQL, focusing on writing clean, readable code
                that is easy to maintain and scale. I value simplicity,
                performance, and usability, and I aim to build applications that
                solve real problems rather than add unnecessary complexity.
              </p>
              <p>
                I enjoy collaborating with others, learning from feedback, and
                continuously improving my skills. Whether it’s refining a UI,
                improving backend logic, or debugging an issue, I like
                understanding why things work the way they do.
              </p>
              <p>
                Outside of coding, you’ll find me learning emerging web
                technologies, exploring modern design trends, and strengthening
                core software fundamentals. In my free time, I enjoy playing
                football, badminton, and cricket, which help me stay disciplined
                and maintain a healthy, balanced routine.
